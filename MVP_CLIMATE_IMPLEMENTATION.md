- **No Internet Required**: Critical for rural areas with limited connectivity

## 🤖 AI Climate Change Integration

### Inflection AI API Integration
- **API Key**: `XHinNJ5ZVEIG6Et4vcRbOYUdbr3KCLODFj2U2HPJY`
- **Climate Adaptation Focus**: All insights target climate resilience strategies
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Drought adaptation, flood management, heat resilience

### AI-Enhanced Data Visualizations
Every chart and visualization includes climate adaptation insights:

1. **Temperature Analysis**: Heat-resilient infrastructure recommendations
2. **Rainfall Patterns**: Water harvesting and drought preparation strategies  
3. **Humidity Trends**: Health adaptation and agricultural guidance
4. **Drought Risk**: Early warning and community preparedness measures
5. **County Comparisons**: Regional adaptation strategy recommendations
