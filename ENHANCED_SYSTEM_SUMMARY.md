### 2. Enhanced Climate Service
- **Prediction Algorithms**: 6-month weather forecasting with confidence scoring
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Historical data analysis with trend detection
- **Seasonal Pattern Modeling**: Monthly baselines for temperature, rainfall, humidity, and NDVI
- **Drought Risk Assessment**: Advanced risk scoring and early warning system

### 3. Advanced API Endpoints
- `/api/climate/counties` - Get all 47 counties with basic information
- `/api/climate/counties/search` - Search counties by name or climate zone
- `/api/climate/counties/{id}/historical` - Historical climate data (1-60 months)
- `/api/climate/counties/{id}/predictions` - Weather predictions (1-12 months ahead)
- `/api/climate/counties/{id}/visualization-data` - Data optimized for charts
- `/api/climate/comparison` - Compare multiple counties
- `/api/climate/drought-risk/assessment` - Comprehensive drought risk analysis
- `/api/climate/analytics/trends` - Climate trends analysis

### 4. Interactive Visualization Components

#### County Climate Visualization
- **Multiple Chart Types**: Line charts, area charts, bar charts, and combined views
- **Customizable Timeframes**: 3, 6, 12, or 24 months
- **Prediction Integration**: Future weather predictions with confidence intervals

- **Sortable Views**: Sort by risk level, county name, or climate zone

### 5. User Interface Features
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Interactive Controls**: Dropdown menus, checkboxes, and real-time updates
- **Visual Indicators**: Progress bars, color coding, and status indicators
- **Export Capabilities**: Download data in JSON format
